# Swapy


###  Web application build with Vue and Firebase and vuex as state management. The main idea of the application is to make people swap items between each other. You simply create an account and create the item/items that he/she would to swap with other users and if the other user accepts the deal you will get an update in the status and you can send the user an email to complete the deal.
